# Titanic Survival Prediction

A simple machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression.

## Overview
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset  
- Goal: Predict survival (Yes/No) based on passenger features  
- Steps: Data cleaning → EDA → Feature engineering → Model training → Evaluation  
- Result: Achieved ~81 percent accuracy 

## Key Insights
- Women had much higher survival rates than men  
- 1st class passengers survived more often than 3rd class  
- Younger passengers had slightly better odds  

## Tech Stack
Python
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Open and run `TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb`
